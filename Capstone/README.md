# Python Code Generator
['TOC']
The objective of this project is to showcase transformers - BERT abilities to generate python code from normal english statements
Training dataset for this project can be found <a href>here </a>

## Model

```
```

## Experiments

- Normal training the source code on the training dataset

- Using pretrained embeddings for the training of statements

- Using self trained embeddings from scratch for Python code

- Study different loss functions and eval metrics and check their performance on the models


## Results of the above Experiments
